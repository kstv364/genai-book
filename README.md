## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genaibook.git
   cd genaibook
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Most notebooks use Python 3.10+ and popular libraries like `transformers`, `diffusers`, `langchain`, and more.
   - Install requirements as needed per notebook, e.g.:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Some notebooks include installation cells for specific packages.

3. **Run the notebooks:**
   - Open with JupyterLab or VS Code.
   - Follow the instructions and code cells in each notebook.
