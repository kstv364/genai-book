In addition to his R&D work at answer.ai, he focuses on sharing knowledge via the DataScienceCastnet YouTube channel and various free online resources he has created.

## Getting the Book

The book is available on:

* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Generative-Transformers-Diffusion-Models/dp/1098149246)
* [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-generative-ai/9781098149239/)

## Usage

To get the most out of this book, we recommend running the code examples as you read along. Experimenting with the code by making changes and exploring different scenarios will enhance your understanding. Working with transformers and diffusion models can be computationally intensive, so having access to a computer with an  GPU is needed.

There are multiple online options that you can use, such as Google Colaboratory and Kaggle Notebooks. Most code should work on any Google Colab instance. We recommend you use GPU runtimes, which provide a T4 for free, specially for chapters with training loops. 

There are many support utilities and helper functions used throughout the book. To access them, please install the _genaibook_ package:

```
pip install genaibook
```

This will, in turn, install the libraries required to run transformers and diffusion models, along with PyTorch, Matplotlib, NumPy, and other essentials.
